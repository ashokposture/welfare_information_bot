Welfare Scheme Information Bot

**Introduction**
This bot is created for the civilians of India who often lack information about various welfare schemes available to them. While there are plenty of websites that provide information on different schemes, it is not feasible for everyone to keep track of all of them. Therefore, as a response to the pressing need for accessible information, we have taken the initiative to create this information bot, which provides accurate and relevant information to users in a very short time span.

**Features**
Input Options: This bot operates on both text and voice input, making it user-friendly and accessible.
Output Options: It provides both text and voice output, ensuring that information gathering is easy and less time-consuming.
